#__Final Exercises__#

## Exercise 1 
__Sampling Distributions, Functions and For Loops__

*Recall that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately a Normal distribution, and that the standard error is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. This holds true regardless of the distribution of our population.*

*For this problem, assume that the number of miles that a particular car can run before its battery wears out is exponentially distributed with an average of 10,000 miles. The exponential distribution looks like this:*

![](C:/Users/Eeslami/Desktop/UCB Courses/X415.2 - Introduction to Data Science/compscix-415-2-assignments/exponentialdist.png){width=500px}

*The exponential distribution has a rate parameter that controls how quickly the distribution decays and defines what the mean and standard deviation will be. In our case the rate = 1/10000, the mean = 10000 and the standard deviation = 10000. You can sample from this exponential distribution in R using this code:*

```{r ex1_intro, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
sample size
samp_size <- 100
# set the rate parameter
samp_rate <- 1/10000
# take sample
rexp(n = samp_size, rate = samp_rate)
```

### Step 1 

*Write an R function that does the following:*

* Takes a sample of size samp_size from this exponential distribution (samp_size is an input parameter for the function)
* Calculates the mean of that sample
* Calculates the standard deviation of that sample
* Returns the calculated mean and standard deviation as a list

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex1_step1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
samp_fun <- function(samp_size, samp_rate) {
  exp_samp <- rexp(n = samp_size, rate = samp_rate)
  samp_avg = mean(exp_samp)
  samp_std_dev = sd(exp_samp)
  stats <- list(samp_avg = samp_avg, samp_std_dev = samp_std_dev)
return(stats)
}
```

* * *

### Step 2 

*Then write a loop that does this:*

* Runs the above function 1000 times, with samp_size = 50 and samp_rate = 1/10000
* Saves all of the sample means in a vector called sample_means, and all of the sample standard deviations in a vector called sample_sds

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex1_step2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
n <- 1000 # number of times we want to run the function
sample_means <- rep(NA, n) # empty vector for saving sample means
sample_sds <- rep(NA, n) # empty vector for saving sample standard deviations

for(i in 1:n) {
  x <- samp_fun(50, 1/10000) # save sample mean and sd
  sample_means[i] <- x$samp_avg # add sample mean to vector
  sample_sds[i] <- x$samp_std_dev # add sample sd to vector
}

# save output in a tibble
exp_samp_df <- tibble(
  sample_means, 
  sample_sds
) 
```

* * *

### Step 3

*Then*

* plot your sample means as a histogram
* output the standard deviation of your sample means
* calculate the theoretical standard error ($\sigma$ = 10000, n = sample size)
* calculate the mean of the sample standard deviations and use this to calculate the empirical standard error

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex1_step3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Plot the sample means
exp_samp_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Standard deviation of the sample means
sd(exp_samp_df$sample_means)

# Calculate the theoretical standard error
10000/sqrt(50)

# Calculate the mean of the sample standard deviations and use this to calculate the empirical standard error
mean(exp_samp_df$sample_sds)/sqrt(50)
```

* * *

### Step 4 

*Repeat STEP 2 and STEP 3 using a sample size of 500 and 5000.*

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex1_step4_a, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
n <- 1000 
sample_means <- rep(NA, n) 
sample_sds <- rep(NA, n) 

# Using sample size of 500
for(i in 1:n) {
  x <- samp_fun(500, 1/10000) # save sample mean and sd
  sample_means[i] <- x$samp_avg # add sample mean to vector
  sample_sds[i] <- x$samp_std_dev # add sample sd to vector
}

# save output in a tibble
exp_samp_500_df <- tibble(
  sample_means, 
  sample_sds
) 

# Plot the sample means
exp_samp_500_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Standard deviation of the sample means
sd(exp_samp_500_df$sample_means)

# Calculate the theoretical standard error
10000/sqrt(500)

# Calculate the mean of the sample standard deviations and use this to calculate the empirical standard error
mean(exp_samp_500_df$sample_sds)/sqrt(500)
```


```{r ex1_step4_b, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
n <- 1000 
sample_means <- rep(NA, n) 
sample_sds <- rep(NA, n) 

# Using sample size of 5000
for(i in 1:n) {
  x <- samp_fun(5000, 1/10000) # save sample mean and sd
  sample_means[i] <- x$samp_avg # add sample mean to vector
  sample_sds[i] <- x$samp_std_dev # add sample sd to vector
}

# save output in a tibble
exp_samp_5000_df <- tibble(
  sample_means, 
  sample_sds
) 

# Plot the sample means
exp_samp_5000_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Standard deviation of the sample means
sd(exp_samp_5000_df$sample_means)

# Calculate the theoretical standard error
10000/sqrt(5000)

# Calculate the mean of the sample standard deviations and use this to calculate the empirical standard error
mean(exp_samp_5000_df$sample_sds)/sqrt(5000)
```

## Exercise 2 
__Linear Regression__

*For this exercise we will return to the House Prices prediction dataset that we used for HW 7. You should have already downloaded the train.csv dataset before, but if you didn't you can download it from Canvas in this week's module.*

*Load the train.csv dataset into R and fit a regression model with:*

* y = SalePrice
* Features: LotArea, OverallQual, and ExterQual

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex2_load_fit, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Load the train.csv dataset
train_df_path <- 'C:/Users/Eeslami/Desktop/UCB Courses/X415.2 - Introduction to Data Science/compscix-415-2-assignments/train.csv'
train_df <- read_csv(file = train_df_path)

# Fit a regression model with y = SalePrice and use LotArea, OverallQual, and ExterQual as features
sales_mult_lm <- lm(formula = SalePrice ~ LotArea + OverallQual + ExterQual, data = train_df)
```

*Answer these questions:*

1. Use the broom package to output the coefficients and the R-squared
2. Interpret the coefficient on LotArea
3. Interpret the coefficient on ExterQualGd
4. Compare this model to the model we fit in HW 7 with GrLivArea, OverallQual, Neighborhood. Which is the better fitting model?

__ANSWERS:__ 

1. See below.

2. For every one unit increase in LotArea, the sale price increases, on average, by $1.45. 

3. ExterQual is an unordered categorical variable, so the coefficient can be interpreted as a comparison to the first value in ExterQual. Therefore, the mean price difference between ExterQualGd and the first value (ExterQualEx) is -$71,529.

4. The model we fit in HW 7 with GrLivArea, OverallQual, Neighborhood had an adjusted R-squared value of 0.78. Our model here does not fit as well, shown by the lower adjusted R-squared value of 0.69. Therefore the model fit for HW 7 is better.

```{r ex2_answerQs, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Use the broom package to output the coefficients and the R-squared
library(broom)
tidy(sales_mult_lm)
glance(sales_mult_lm)
```

## Exercise 3 
__AB Testing__

*Download the ab_test_data.csv file from Canvas. This file contains two columns: version and conversion. Each row is a visitor to a webpage. The version column tells us which version of the webpage the visitor saw, and the conversion column is a binary value and equals 1 if the visitor converted (0 otherwise).*

*We want to perform an AB test on this data to see if the conversion rates are different for the two versions of the webpage.*

*Answer these questions:*

* What proportion of visitors converted for each version of the webpage?
* Perform the AB test in R. What is the p-value for the AB test (hypothesis test of proportions)?

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex2_load_fit, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Load the ab_test_data.csv dataset
ab_test_df_path <- 'C:/Users/Eeslami/Desktop/UCB Courses/X415.2 - Introduction to Data Science/compscix-415-2-assignments/ab_test_data.csv'
ab_test_df <- read_csv(file = ab_test_df_path)
