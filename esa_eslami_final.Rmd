#__Final Exercises__#

## Exercise 1 
__Sampling Distributions, Functions and For Loops__

*Recall that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately a Normal distribution, and that the standard error is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. This holds true regardless of the distribution of our population.*

*For this problem, assume that the number of miles that a particular car can run before its battery wears out is exponentially distributed with an average of 10,000 miles. The exponential distribution looks like this:*

![](C:/Users/Eeslami/Desktop/UCB Courses/X415.2 - Introduction to Data Science/compscix-415-2-assignments/exponentialdist.png){width=500px}

*The exponential distribution has a rate parameter that controls how quickly the distribution decays and defines what the mean and standard deviation will be. In our case the rate = 1/10000, the mean = 10000 and the standard deviation = 10000. You can sample from this exponential distribution in R using this code:*

```{r ex1_intro, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
sample size
samp_size <- 100
# set the rate parameter
samp_rate <- 1/10000
# take sample
rexp(n = samp_size, rate = samp_rate)
```

### Step 1 

*Write an R function that does the following:*

* Takes a sample of size samp_size from this exponential distribution (samp_size is an input parameter for the function)
* Calculates the mean of that sample
* Calculates the standard deviation of that sample
* Returns the calculated mean and standard deviation as a list

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex1_step1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
samp_fun <- function(samp_size, samp_rate) {
  exp_samp <- rexp(n = samp_size, rate = samp_rate)
  samp_avg = mean(exp_samp)
  samp_std_dev = sd(exp_samp)
  stats <- list(samp_avg = samp_avg, samp_std_dev = samp_std_dev)
return(stats)
}
```

* * *

### Step 2 

*Then write a loop that does this:*

* Runs the above function 1000 times, with samp_size = 50 and samp_rate = 1/10000
* Saves all of the sample means in a vector called sample_means, and all of the sample standard deviations in a vector called sample_sds

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex1_step2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
n <- 1000 # number of times we want to run the function
sample_means <- rep(NA, n) # empty vector for saving sample means
sample_sds <- rep(NA, n) # empty vector for saving sample standard deviations

for(i in 1:n) {
  x <- samp_fun(50, 1/10000) # save sample mean and sd
  sample_means[i] <- x$samp_avg # add sample mean to vector
  sample_sds[i] <- x$samp_std_dev # add sample sd to vector
}

# save output in a tibble
exp_samp_df <- tibble(
  sample_means, 
  sample_sds
) 
```

* * *

### Step 3 

*Then*

* plot your sample means as a histogram
* output the standard deviation of your sample means
* calculate the theoretical standard error ($\sigma$ = 10000, n = sample size)
* calculate the mean of the sample standard deviations and use this to calculate the empirical standard error

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex1_step3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Plot the sample means
exp_samp_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Standard deviation of the sample means
sd(exp_samp_df$sample_means)

# Calculate the theoretical standard error
10000/sqrt(50)

# Calculate the mean of the sample standard deviations and use this to calculate the empirical standard error
mean(exp_samp_df$sample_sds)/sqrt(50)
```

* * *

### Step 4 

*Repeat STEP 2 and STEP 3 using a sample size of 500 and 5000.*

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex1_step4_a, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
n <- 1000 
sample_means <- rep(NA, n) 
sample_sds <- rep(NA, n) 

# Using sample size of 500
for(i in 1:n) {
  x <- samp_fun(500, 1/10000) # save sample mean and sd
  sample_means[i] <- x$samp_avg # add sample mean to vector
  sample_sds[i] <- x$samp_std_dev # add sample sd to vector
}

# save output in a tibble
exp_samp_500_df <- tibble(
  sample_means, 
  sample_sds
) 

# Plot the sample means
exp_samp_500_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Standard deviation of the sample means
sd(exp_samp_500_df$sample_means)

# Calculate the theoretical standard error
10000/sqrt(500)

# Calculate the mean of the sample standard deviations and use this to calculate the empirical standard error
mean(exp_samp_500_df$sample_sds)/sqrt(500)
```


```{r ex1_step4_b, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
n <- 1000 
sample_means <- rep(NA, n) 
sample_sds <- rep(NA, n) 

# Using sample size of 5000
for(i in 1:n) {
  x <- samp_fun(5000, 1/10000) # save sample mean and sd
  sample_means[i] <- x$samp_avg # add sample mean to vector
  sample_sds[i] <- x$samp_std_dev # add sample sd to vector
}

# save output in a tibble
exp_samp_5000_df <- tibble(
  sample_means, 
  sample_sds
) 

# Plot the sample means
exp_samp_5000_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Standard deviation of the sample means
sd(exp_samp_5000_df$sample_means)

# Calculate the theoretical standard error
10000/sqrt(5000)

# Calculate the mean of the sample standard deviations and use this to calculate the empirical standard error
mean(exp_samp_5000_df$sample_sds)/sqrt(5000)
```
