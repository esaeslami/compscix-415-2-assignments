### Exercise 1 
__Sampling Distributions, Functions and For Loops__

*Recall that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately a Normal distribution, and that the standard error is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. This holds true regardless of the distribution of our population.*

*For this problem, assume that the number of miles that a particular car can run before its battery wears out is exponentially distributed with an average of 10,000 miles. The exponential distribution looks like this:*

![](C:/Users/Eeslami/Desktop/UCB Courses/X415.2 - Introduction to Data Science/compscix-415-2-assignments/exponentialdist.png){width=500px}

*The exponential distribution has a rate parameter that controls how quickly the distribution decays and defines what the mean and standard deviation will be. In our case the rate = 1/10000, the mean = 10000 and the standard deviation = 10000. You can sample from this exponential distribution in R using this code:*

```{r ex1_intro, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
sample size
samp_size <- 100
# set the rate parameter
samp_rate <- 1/10000
# take sample
rexp(n = samp_size, rate = samp_rate)
```

#### Step 1 

*Write an R function that does the following:*

* Takes a sample of size samp_size from this exponential distribution (samp_size is an input parameter for the function)
* Calculates the mean of that sample
* Calculates the standard deviation of that sample
* Returns the calculated mean and standard deviation as a list

__ANSWER:__ See document formatting.

```{r ex1_step1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
samp_fun <- function(samp_size, samp_rate) {

...your code here...

stats <- list(samp_avg = samp_avg, samp_std_dev = samp_std_dev)
return(stats)
}
```
