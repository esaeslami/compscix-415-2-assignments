##__Homework 7 Assignments:__##

### Exercise 1

*Create an R function that takes as its input argument a city name and creates a slippy leaflet map as its output.* 

*The leaflet map should already be __zoomed__ in onto the city that is input into the function and should contain __markers__ for each of the bike station locations, and each marker should show the __number of bikes__ when hovered over by the mouse cursor.*

*Feel free to add your own flourishes to the map.* 

*On your final html document __I want to see the code and one slippy map for any of the given cities__. Do not attempt to put multiple slippy maps on your html file - it may break. Name your function map_it. To pull the data, you will use the fromJSON function (set the flatten argument to TRUE).*

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r ex1_q1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
#Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(leaflet)
library(jsonlite)

#Create an R function called map_it that takes as its input argument a city name (city_name) and creates a slippy leaflet map as its output
map_it <- function(city_name) {
  url <- paste0("https://api.jcdecaux.com/vls/v1/stations?contract=",city_name,"&apiKey=095ad1453efb40f3ce95a612d16bddbcb2f41d68")
  df_api <- fromJSON(url)
  df_api_lat <- df_api$position[[1]]
  df_api_long <- df_api$position[[2]]
  df_api_number <- as.character(df_api$number)
  map <- leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(lng = df_api_long, lat = df_api_lat, data = df_api, label = df_api_number)
  return(map)
}
map_it("Dublin")
```
