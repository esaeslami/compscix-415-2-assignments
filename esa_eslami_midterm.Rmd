##__Midterm Exercises__##

### RStudio and R Markdown

*1. Use markdown headers in your document to clearly separate each midterm question and add a table of
contents to your document.*

__ANSWER:__ See document formatting.

* * *

### The tidyverse packages

*By now you’ve used at least five different packages from the tidyverse for plotting, data munging, reshaping data, importing/exporting data, and using tibbles (the tibble package is used for this without you even realizing it’s there).*

*1. Can you name which package is associated with each task below?*

__ANSWER:__ 

* Plotting - __ggplot2__
* Data munging/wrangling - __dplry__
* Reshaping (speading and gathering) data - __tidyr__
* Importing/exporting data - __readr__

* * *

*2. Now can you name two functions that you’ve used from each package that you listed above for these tasks?*

__ANSWER:__ 

* Plotting - __ggplot(), geom_point()__ 
* Data munging/wrangling - __select(), filter()__ 
* Reshaping (speading and gathering) data - __gather(), spread()__ 
* Importing/exporting data - __read_csv(), write_csv()__ 

* * *

### R Basics

*1. Fix this code with the fewest number of changes possible so it works:*

```{r rbasics_q1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
My_data.name___is.too00ooLong! <- c( 1 , 2 , 3 )
```

__ANSWER:__ The code will work if you simply remove the exclamation point:

```{r rbasics_a1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# This vector name is still very bad
My_data.name___is.too00ooLong <- c( 1 , 2 , 3 )
# See contents of new vector
My_data.name___is.too00ooLong
```
* * *

*2. Fix this code so it works:*

```{r rbasics_q2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
my_string <- C('has', 'an', 'error', 'in', 'it)
```

__ANSWER:__ The c() needs to be lowercase and the last value needs a second quotation mark:

```{r rbasics_a2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Corrected code
my_string <- c('has', 'an', 'error', 'in', 'it')
# See contents of new vector
my_string
```
* * *

*3. Look at the code below and comment on what happened to the values in the vector.*

```{r rbasics_q3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
my_vector <- c(1, 2, '3', '4', 5)
my_vector
```

__ANSWER:__ Because 3 and 4 were entered as characters, all values of the vector were converted to character as well. 

* * *

### Data import/export

*1. Download the rail_trail.txt file from Canvas (in the Midterm Exam section) and successfully import it into R. Prove that it was imported successfully by including your import code and taking a glimpse of the result.*

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r import_export_a1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Set file path equal to location of rail_trail.txt file  
rail_trail_path <- 'C:/Users/Eeslami/Desktop/UCB Courses/X415.2 - Introduction to Data Science/compscix-415-2-assignments/rail_trail.txt'
#Load rail_trail.txt file into R 
rail_trail_df <- read_delim(file = rail_trail_path, delim = '|')
#Look at data to make sure it loaded correctly
glimpse(rail_trail_df)
```

* * *

*2. Export the file into a comma-separated file and name it “rail_trail.csv”. Make sure you define the path correctly so that you know where it gets saved. Then reload the file. Include your export and import code and take another glimpse.*

__ANSWER:__ 

```{r import_export_a2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Export rail_trail_df as ‘rail_trail.csv’
write_delim(rail_trail_df, delim = ',', path = 'C:/Users/Eeslami/Desktop/UCB Courses/X415.2 - Introduction to Data Science/compscix-415-2-assignments/rail_trail.csv')
#Reload rail_trail.csv 
rail_trail_df2 <- read.csv(file = 'rail_trail.csv')
#Look at data to make sure it loaded correctly
glimpse(rail_trail_df2)
```

* * *

### Visualization

*1. Critique this graphic. Give only three examples of what is wrong with this graphic. Be concise.*

![](C:/Users/Eeslami/Desktop/UCB Courses/X415.2 - Introduction to Data Science/compscix-415-2-assignments/mrspresident.jpg) 
 
__ANSWER:__ 

1. The graphic mixes age and gender on the vertical axis, which initially makes you think there are five mutually exclusive values when there are not. 
2. The color coding initially makes you think there is some significance to the bottom two rows, but they are just arbitrarily using color for the male/female rows. 
3. The age rows are presented in a counter-intuitive order, with older ages appearing lower than younger ages. 

* * *

*2. Reproduce this graphic using the diamonds data set.*

![](C:/Users/Eeslami/Desktop/UCB Courses/X415.2 - Introduction to Data Science/compscix-415-2-assignments/caratofdiamond.png) 

__ANSWER:__  
```{r visualization_a2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut,y = carat, fill = color)) + 
  geom_boxplot(position = 'identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("CUT OF DIAMOND") +
  ylab("CARAT OF DIAMOND")
```

* * *

*3. The previous graphic is not very useful. We can make it much more useful by changing one thing about it. Make the change and plot it again.*

__ANSWER:__  The graphic above places all of the color histograms on top of each other so that it is impossible to distinguish much difference by color. Changing position to "dodge" will greatly improve the plot.
```{r visualization_a3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut,y = carat, fill = color)) + 
  geom_boxplot(position = 'dodge') +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("CUT OF DIAMOND") +
  ylab("CARAT OF DIAMOND")
```
